# Signed HTTP webhooks for replayt run and approval lifecycle events

## Overview

This project builds on **[replayt](https://pypi.org/project/replayt/)**. It declares a runtime dependency on
**replayt `>=0.4.25`** (see `pyproject.toml`). Read **[docs/REPLAYT_ECOSYSTEM_IDEA.md](docs/REPLAYT_ECOSYSTEM_IDEA.md)**
for positioning prompts, then **[docs/MISSION.md](docs/MISSION.md)** for scope and goals (stubs until you flesh them out).

**Compatibility:** After `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, check the installed **replayt** with either:

```bash
pip show replayt
```

or:

```bash
python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('replayt'))"
```

**Upstream changes:** PyPI lists versions under [Release history](https://pypi.org/project/replayt/#history) on the
[replayt project page](https://pypi.org/project/replayt/). This package does not mirror upstream release notes; use
that history (and upstream’s own changelog or GitHub Releases when you need prose per release).

**Report breakage:** Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/flogat/replayt-lifecycle-webhooks/issues).

## Design principles

**[docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)** covers **replayt** compatibility, versioning, and (for showcases)
**LLM** boundaries.


## Reference documentation (optional)

This checkout does not yet include [`docs/reference-documentation/`](docs/reference-documentation/). You can add markdown
copies of upstream replayt documentation there for offline review or agent context.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Optional agent workflows

This repo may include a [`.cursor/skills/`](.cursor/skills/) directory for Cursor-style agent skills. **`.gitignore`**
lists **`path/`** (so documentation-style placeholder paths are never committed), **`.cursor/skills/`**, and related
local tooling entries. Adapt or remove optional directories to match your team’s workflow.
